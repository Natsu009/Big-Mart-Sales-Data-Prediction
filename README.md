### Item Outlet Sales vs Item MRP:

It can be seen in graph we can see that in sales Supermarket Type 1 dominates compared to other type of outlets. However, it is interesting to see the gaps in the prices around 60,130 and 200. There could be many reason for why there are gaps in the prices, it could be because prices for different categories differ and which led to the gaps.

### Item Visibility and Item Sales vs Item Type:

This graph indicates that when Item Visibility and for a item category is directly proportional to aggregate sales for that particular category. Those category, who had the highest visibility had the highest sales. This finding could help sell those categories which have lower sales and have high MRP. Categories like dairy could benefit as they are highly consumed by general population and have a varied range of prices.

### Item Visibility vs Item Outlet Sales

Our observations in the previous do not hold when we see at the sales of Items in different outlets. Here the grocery store does have a uniform distribution even for items which have higher visibility. Even for Supermarket Type 3 some of Items with high sales have lower visibility compared to other items.
